# The FineCast App
The Finecast App is based on Ionic and Typecast.


### Install
To install the app, look at the Ionicframework.com documentation.
If you're too lazy for that right now, this does the trick:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Cloudoki/finecast-app.git finecast-app
cd finecast-app
npm install
```

### Run
To run the serve, please execute the following from the root finecast-app directory:

ionic serve
```

and open the local url in your browser:

```

That's all folks.
